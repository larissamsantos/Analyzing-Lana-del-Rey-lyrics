0,Ride (Monologue),https://www.vagalume.com.br/lana-del-rey/ride-monologue.html,"I was in the winter of my life And the men that I met along the road were my only summer. At night, I fell asleep with visions of myself Dancing and laughing and crying with them. Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour And my memories of them were the only things that Substained me and my only real happy times. I was a singer, not a very popular one, Who one had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet - But upon an unfortunate series of events Saw those dreams dashed And divided like a millions stars in the night sky That I wished on over and over again - sparkling and broken. But I didn't really mind because I knew That it takes getting everything You ever wanted and then losing it To know what true freedom is. When the people I used to know Found out what I had been doing How I had been living - they asked me why. But there's no use in talking to people who have a home, They have no idea what it's like to seek safety I In other people, For home to be wherever you lie your head. I was always an unusual girl, My mother told me I had a chameleon soul. No morall compass pointing due north, no fixed personality. Just an inner indecisiveness That was as wide and as wavering as the ocean. And if I said that I didn't plan For it to turn out this was, I'd be lying - Because I was born to be the other woman. I belong to no one - who belonged to everyone, Who had nothing, who wanted everything With a fire for every experience And an obsession for freedom That terrified me to the point I couldn't even talk about - And pushed me to a nomatic point Of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me."" I've been out on that open road You can be my full time, daddy White and gold Singing blues has been getting old You can be my full time, baby Hot or cold Don't break me down I've been traveling too long I've been trying too hard With one pretty song I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast I am alone in the night Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I I've got a war in my mind So, I just ride, I just ride I just ride, I just ride Dying young and I'm playing hard That's the way my father made his life an art Drink all day and we talk 'til dark That's the way the road doves do it, ride 'til dark Don't leave me now Don't say goodbye Don't turn around Leave me high and dry I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast I am alone in the night Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I I've got a war in my mind I just ride, I just ride I just ride, I just ride I'm tired of feeling like I'm f*cking crazy I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes I look up to hear myself saying ""Baby, too much I strive, I just ride"" I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast I am alone in the night Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I I've got a war in my mind I just ride, I just ride I just ride, I just ride ""Every night I used to pray that I'd find my people - And finally I did - on the open road. We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain Nothing we desired anymore - Except to make our lives into a work of art. Live fast. Die young. Be wild, and have fun I believe in the country America used to be. I believe in the person I want to become. I believe in the freedom of the open road. And my motto is the same as ever - I believe in the kindness of strangers. And when I'm at war with myself - I ride. I just ride. Who are you? Are you in touch with all your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you're free to experience them? I have! I am fucking crazy, but I am free!"

No such thing as heaven And I'm the last girl on Earth. So, baby, let's get it on. Know such thing as heaven And I'm the last girl on Earth So baby, let's get it on.</div>"

Built from the ground up, by hand, by your very first owner Quiet world war one, aviation pilot I tried to save you but the German Shepherd seemed more important Paradise is very fragile and it seems like it's only getting worse Our leader is a megalomaniac And we've seen that before But never 'cause it was what the country deserved My friends tell me to stop calling 911 on the culture but it's either that or I 5150 myself They don't understand I'm a dreamer And I had big dreams for the country Not for what it could do, but how it could feel How it could think, how it could dream I know Who am I to dream for you? It's just that in my own mind I was born with a little bit of paradise I was lucky in that way Not like my husband Who was born and raised in hell I always had something gentle to give All of me, in fact It's one of the beautiful things about me It's one of the beautiful things about nature But lately I've been thinking that I wish Someone had told me when I was younger More about the inhabitants that thrive off of paradise That should they take too much There would be nothing left to give Not everyone's nature is golden and green And you can't fight what's in your nature I got to thinking about it as We were fighting the fires in Agora But I'm tired of fighting you Paradise is very fragile and it's only getting worse And every time I think of that I think about the curse bestowed about Eve, that fateful eve She took that bite of fruit from that fruitful tree And this summer night, you in front of me Makes me contemplate the origins of good and evil Because you take and you take and you take and you take But you taste like the beach and a kiss Candy from my eyes In my veins you run citrus Watercolor images of serpents on orange trees Arise in my midst Kundalini, you breathe me I could do this forever But my heart is very fragile and I have nothing left to give</div>"

Used to say that I was beautiful, Like Cleopatra, But you the king too so I would say, “Back at'cha!” I flip my hair and make you stare, And put my make-up on, And make up stories ‘bout my life, And put on Very Cherry Bomb. And even then I knew that we were, Something serious, That you would dominate my thoughts of, Radio Two serials. I'd see you in the hall like, “Hello, hello” Up against the wall like, “Let's go, let's go!” Let me take you out of this town, Let me do it right now, baby, Dancing till dawn, staying forever young. Let's get out of this place, ‘Cause you're starting to waste, Within this teenage wasteland. You will never see my face, If you don't get me out of this place, Now, baby, I'm not crazy. I'm leaving, are you coming with me? If you're lonely, baby, hold me, You're my only one. Watching television, kissin', Till we see the sun. So far, we are, Safe in the dark. And I never dreamed, That I'd be the queen, And I'd be so happy, That I could die. You used to call yourself “the Don”, And me “Queen Diana”, You always make me blush I say, “Shut up, boy, you bananas.” You pull my hair and push me down, And chase me, make me run, You play me Biggie Smalls and then, My first Nirvana song. So even then when no one's friends, Were really serious, I knew you loved me by the way, You looked in second period. I'd see you in the hall like, “Hello, hello” Up against the wall like, “Let's go, let's go!” Let me take you out of this town, Let me do it right now, baby, Dancing till dawn, staying forever young.

254,Ride (Monologue),https://www.vagalume.com.br/lana-del-rey/ride-monologue.html,"I was in the winter of my life And the men that I met along the road were my only summer. At night, I fell asleep with visions of myself Dancing and laughing and crying with them. Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour And my memories of them were the only things that Substained me and my only real happy times. I was a singer, not a very popular one, Who one had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet - But upon an unfortunate series of events Saw those dreams dashed And divided like a millions stars in the night sky That I wished on over and over again - sparkling and broken. But I didn't really mind because I knew That it takes getting everything You ever wanted and then losing it To know what true freedom is. When the people I used to know Found out what I had been doing How I had been living - they asked me why. But there's no use in talking to people who have a home, They have no idea what it's like to seek safety I In other people, For home to be wherever you lie your head. I was always an unusual girl, My mother told me I had a chameleon soul. No morall compass pointing due north, no fixed personality. Just an inner indecisiveness That was as wide and as wavering as the ocean. And if I said that I didn't plan For it to turn out this was, I'd be lying - Because I was born to be the other woman. I belong to no one - who belonged to everyone, Who had nothing, who wanted everything With a fire for every experience And an obsession for freedom That terrified me to the point I couldn't even talk about - And pushed me to a nomatic point Of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me."" I've been out on that open road You can be my full time, daddy White and gold Singing blues has been getting old You can be my full time, baby Hot or cold Don't break me down I've been traveling too long I've been trying too hard With one pretty song I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast I am alone in the night Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I I've got a war in my mind So, I just ride, I just ride I just ride, I just ride Dying young and I'm playing hard That's the way my father made his life an art Drink all day and we talk 'til dark That's the way the road doves do it, ride 'til dark Don't leave me now Don't say goodbye Don't turn around Leave me high and dry I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast I am alone in the night Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I I've got a war in my mind I just ride, I just ride I just ride, I just ride I'm tired of feeling like I'm f*cking crazy I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes I look up to hear myself saying ""Baby, too much I strive, I just ride"" I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast I am alone in the night Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I I've got a war in my mind I just ride, I just ride I just ride, I just ride ""Every night I used to pray that I'd find my people - And finally I did - on the open road. We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain Nothing we desired anymore - Except to make our lives into a work of art. Live fast. Die young. Be wild, and have fun I believe in the country America used to be. I believe in the person I want to become. I believe in the freedom of the open road. And my motto is the same as ever - I believe in the kindness of strangers. And when I'm at war with myself - I ride. I just ride. Who are you? Are you in touch with all your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you're free to experience them? I have! I am fucking crazy, but I am free!"

269,SportCruiser,https://www.vagalume.com.br/lana-del-rey/sportcruiser.html,"I took a flying lesson on my 33rd birthday, instead of calling you Or parking on the block where our old place used to be Genesee, genesee, genesee Pathetic, I know - but sometimes I still like to park on that street And have lunch in the car just to feel close to you I was once in love with my life here In that studio apartment with you Little yellow flowers on the tops of trees as our only view Out of the only window Big enough for me to see our future through But it turned out I was the only one who could see it Stupid apartment complex Terrible you You, who I wait for You, you, you Like a broken record stuck on loop So that day, on my birthday, I thought ""Something has to change"" You can't always be about waiting for you Don't tell anyone, but part of my reasoning for taking the flight class, was this idea that if I could become my own navigator The captain of the sky That perhaps I could stop looking for direction from you Well, what started off as an idea on a whim Has turned into something more Too shy to explain to the owners that my first lesson was just a one-time thing I've continued to go to classes each week At the precious little strip off Santa Monica and Bundy And everything was going fine We were starting with dips and loops and then something terrible happened During my fourth lesson in the sky My instructor, younger than I, but as tough as you Instructed me to do a simple maneuverer It's not that I didn't do it But I was slow to lean the sports cruiser into a right hand upward turn Scared, scared that I would lose control of the plane Not tactfully and not gently The instructor shook his head, and without looking at me said “You don't trust yourself” I was horrified Feeling as though I'd somehow been found out Like he knew me How weak I was Of course, he was only talking about my ability as a pilot in the sky But I knew it was meant for me to hear those words For me, they held a deeper meaning I didn't trust myself Not just 25, 000 feet above the coast of Malibu But with anything And I didn't trust you I could've said something but I was quiet Because pilots aren't like poets They don't make metaphors between life and the sky In the midst of this mid-life, meltdown, navigational exercise in self-examination I also decided to do something else I always wanted to do Take sailing lessons in the vibrant bay of Marina del Ray I signed up for the class as ""Elizabeth Grant"" And nobody blinked an eye So, why was I so sure that when I walked into the tiny shack on Valley Way, someone would say “You're not a captain of a ship, or a master of the sky! ” No, the fisherman didn't care, and so neither did I And for a brief moment, I felt more myself than ever before Letting the self proclaimed drunkard captain's lessons wash over me like the foamy tops of the sea Midway through my forehead burned and my hands raw from driving The captain told me the most important thing I'd need to know on the sea “Never run the ship into irons” That's nautical terms for not sailing the boat directly into the wind In order to do that though, you have to know where the wind is coming from And you might not have time to look up to the mast Or up further to the weathervane So you have to feel where the wind is coming from On your cheeks, and by the tips of the white waves from which direction they're rolling To do this, he gave me an exercise He told me to close my eyes, and asked me to feel on my neck which way the wind was blowing I already knew I was going to get it wrong “The wind is coming from everywhere, I feel it all over” I told him “No”, he said “the wind is coming from the left. The portside” I sat waiting for him to tell me “You don't trust yourself” But he didn't, so I said it for him “I don't trust myself” He laughed gentler than the pilot, but still not realising that my failure in the exercise was hitting me at a much deeper lever “It's not that you don't trust yourself” he said. “it's simply that you're not a captain. It isn't what you do” Then he told me he wanted me to practise everyday so I would get better “Which grocery store do you go to? ” he asked “To the Ralphs in the Palisades” I replied “Okay. When you're in the Ralphs in the Palisades I want you, as you're walking from your car to the store To close your eyes, and feel which way the wind is blowing Now, I don't want you to look like a crazy person crouching in the middle of the parking lot but everywhere you go I want you to try and find which way the wind is coming in from And then, determine if it's from the port or starboard side So when you're back on the boat you have a better sense of it” I thought his advice was adorable I could already picture myself in the parking lot Squinting my eyes with perfect housewives looking on I could picture myself growing a better sense of which way the wind was blowing And as I did, a tiny bit of deeper trust also began to grow within myself I thought of mentioning it but I didn't Because captain's aren't like poets They don't make metaphors between sea and sky And as I thought that to myself I realized that's why I write All this circumnavigating the earth Was to get back to my life Six trips to the moon for my poetry to arise I'm not a captain I'm not a pilot I write!

This isn't where we intended to be We had it all, you believed in me I believed in you Certainties disappear What do we do for our dreams to survive? How do we keep all our passions alive As we used to do? Deep in my heart, I'm concealing Things that I'm longing to say Scared to confess, what I'm feeling Frightened you'll slip away You must love me, you must love me Why are you at my side? How can I be, any use to you now? Give me a chance, and I'll let you see how Nothing has changed Deep in my heart, I'm concealing Things that I'm longing to say Scared to confess, what I'm feeling Frightened you'll slip away You must love me, you must love me You must love me</div>"
332,You're Gonna Love Me,https://www.vagalume.com.br/lana-del-rey/youre-gonna-love-me.html,"Jerry says that anytime, I think I have, A good idea. That I should do the opposite, Of whatever it is I feel. It's because I have a bad mind, And I have gold in my veins, But he says I got the purest heart, That he's ever seen. What God give me a brain for? If he won't let me use it. What God give me a plan for? If he won't help me do it. You're gonna love me, I'm gonna make you, You're gonna love me, I'm gonna make you. Well I can tell that you're the type, To never trust a Beauty Queen, But I was never voted for nothing in High School, Never meaned anything to anybody, Never ever gave myself away, But even when I'm funny, You think I'm actin' so I say. What God give me a brain for? If he won't let me use it. What God give me a plan for? He never helps me do it. You're gonna love me, I'm gonna have to make you, You're gonna love me, I'm gonna make you. You say that you don't want to be hypnotized, But baby I, I don't wanna hypnotize you. There's nothing from you that I wanna take, I just wanna be like you, Maybe love you just a little bit. Please, Oh oh oh. Jim I'mma dedicate this whole album to you, You told me to get my ??? that's exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna strike out, Right now, I'm strikin' out right now, With this song, But I can't help myself, I can't do right for long. You know that, What God give me a brain for? He knows that I can't use it.</div>"
